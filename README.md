#Dealbreaker Deals Scraper using Tweakers Website
This project is a Python script that scrapes the Tweakers.net website to retrieve the latest dealbreaker deals. Dealbreaker deals are a special type of deal that are so good that they can break a deal between a buyer and a seller.

The script scrapes the dealbreaker deals section of the Tweakers website and retrieves information such as the product name, price, discount percentage, and link to the product page. The information is then stored in a CSV file for easy analysis.
